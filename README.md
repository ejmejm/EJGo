# Project Name

EJ Go Bot by Edan Meyer

## What it is

This is a bot I am developing to play the game Go. The bot uses a deep convolutional network and trains of the moves of skilled (6 dan+) players to choose its moves. It currently has an accuracy of about 50% in choosing the correct moves. In comparison, the state of the art Alpha Go bot holds an accuracy of about 57%.
