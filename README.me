EJ Go Bot by Edan Meyer

## What it is

This is a bot I am developing to play the game Go. The bot is currently in its very early stages, so it is not yet fully functional or clean. It currently uses deep learning to play what moves it would predict a high level dan player would play. In the future I also intend to add Monte Carlo Search in conglomeration with the deep cnn. It can currently predict moves with about a 36% accuracy. By playing against it myself, I would estimate that it is currently in the 23-20kyu range, excpect for when it comes to when to pass.
